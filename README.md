Semantic-Release:
Semantic-release automates the whole package release workflow including determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package. Semantic Release automates the process of managing Semantic Versioning in software development.
Semantic-Versioning:
Semantic Versioning (SemVer) helps to manage software releases in a structured and predictable way, ensuring developers, teams, and end-users understand the impact of new updates. Here’s how it’s typically implemented.
Semantic Versioning (SemVer) works by following a structured set of rules to ensure version numbers clearly convey the nature of changes made to a piece of software. This helps both developers and users understand whether updates will break existing code, add features, or fix bugs.
Version Format:
A semantic version is formatted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
MAJOR: When you make incompatible changes or introduce breaking changes. Any change that could potentially break existing code for user’s increments this version.
MINOR: When you add new functionality in a backward-compatible manner. New features that don’t break current functionality lead to an increment in the MINOR version.
PATCH: When you make backward-compatible bug fixes. Any small fixes that improve the system but don’t add new features or break anything increment the PATCH version.
How Semantic Release Automates Semantic Versioning:
 Semantic Release relies on structured commit messages to determine the type of changes (major, minor, patch) and how the version number should be incremented.
Developers follow a conventional commit format where the type of change is included in the commit message. For example:
 Fix: correct a bug in the login feature (This would trigger a PATCH release).
 Feat: add a new search functionality (This would trigger a MINOR release).
 Breaking change: updated API endpoint (This would trigger a MAJOR release).

•	We have to configure the package.json file specifically for semantic-release:
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",  // This will be updated automatically by semantic-release
  "description": "A brief description of your project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "release": "semantic-release"  // Optional script to run semantic-release
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^19.0.0",
    "@semantic-release/changelog": "^6.0.0",
    "@semantic-release/git": "^10.0.0",
    "@semantic-release/github": "^9.0.0",
    "@semantic-release/npm": "^10.0.0"  // If you're publishing to npm
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC"
}

•	Make sure all your changes are committed, including the release.config.js, updated package.json, and any other relevant files.

•	Use the following command to stage all your modified files:

git add .

•	Create a commit that follows the Conventional Commits standard, which is necessary for semantic-release to detect the type of release to perform.

•	Based on the specified commit types and their associated version bumps

Check CI/CD Pipeline Status
GitHub Actions (or your CI/CD tool)
Go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
Look for the workflow that was triggered by your push.
Check if the workflow completed successfully. If there are any errors, review the logs to diagnose the issue.
